# Rice Leaf Disease Detection

This is a deep learning-powered web application that detects diseases in rice leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Users can upload an image of a rice leaf, and the system will predict the disease, provide a description, suggest remedies, and accept user feedback.

## Features
- Image classification using CNN (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Web interface with Flask
- Displays disease prediction, confidence level, description, and remedy
- Feedback form stored in SQLite database

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- TensorFlow / Keras
- HTML / CSS
- SQLite
